# Rundeck and NGINX web server environment

This is a Docker Compose example to run Rundeck behind an NGINX web server in a reverse proxy configuration.

To run, clone the repository and then execute:

`docker compose up`

After a couple of minutes, the Rundeck environment should be available, open your favorite browser (no IE please!) and access to `http://localhost` URL, user: `admin`, password: `admin`.

Cheers.
